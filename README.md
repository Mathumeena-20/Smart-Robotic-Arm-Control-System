# Smart-Robotic-Arm-Control-System
This project is a full-stack embedded system for robotics, built using Python for backend, Microcontroller (ESP32 / Raspberry Pi) for control, and a frontend dashboard (React/HTML/CSS or Tkinter GUI). The system allows real-time robotic arm control, sensor monitoring, and automation via web/mobile UI.
